      <description>Forwards, the R Foundation taskforce on women and other under-represented groups, is seeking to address issues affecting under-represented groups in general as it works to broaden the participation of women in the R community.
In order to adequately address such issues, we would like to widen the diversity of the taskforce itself. Accordingly, we are inviting people who are part of under-represented groups - be they groups identified by race, gender, sexuality, class or disability - to join us.</description>
