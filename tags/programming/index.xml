      <description>In our first post on the useR! 2016 survey we discussed the responses from the demographic section, finding in particular that:
 The useR! 2016 attendees were predominately men, typically under 40, White/Caucasian and employed full-time. Women attendees tended to be younger and less advanced in their careers. Non-Asian minority races and LGBT individuals were under-represented. Approximately a quarter of attendees were caregivers.  We now turn to look at useRs relationship with R: what experience do they have in using R and what do they think of R?</description>
